# Verification Report: Appointments + Calendar (Slice 3)

**Change**: `appointments-calendar`  
**Slice**: 3  
**Final branch**: `feature/appointments-calendar-pr4`  
**Base chain**: `feature/appointments-calendar-pr4` → `pr3` → `pr2` → `pr1` → `feature/landing-destacados-pr3`  
**Mode**: Standard (Strict TDD inactive; no test runner configured)  
**Report date**: 2026-06-29 (re-verified same day)  

## Verdict: FAIL (remediated, re-verified)

Automated quality gates (`typecheck`, `lint`, `build`) still pass after the focused remediation. The professional `cancelAppointment` and `completeAppointment` server actions are invoked from `DateGroupedAppointments` for `CONFIRMED` appointments with confirmation dialogs and i18n keys. The remaining blocker is the manual scenario task **6.3**, which is still unchecked and unexecuted; without runtime evidence, the slice cannot be archived.

## Remediation Applied

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Professional cancel/complete UI | Actions exported but never invoked | `DateGroupedAppointments` renders **Cancel** and **Complete** buttons for `CONFIRMED` appointments when `role="professional"` |
| Confirmation dialogs | None | `confirm()` dialog shown before cancel or complete with i18n confirmation messages |
| State refresh after action | None | `router.refresh()` called on success; server actions also `revalidatePath` affected routes |
| i18n coverage | `cancel` and `complete` action labels only | Added `appointments.confirmations.cancel` and `appointments.confirmations.complete` in `es.ts` and `en.ts` |

## Completeness

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks total | 18 |
| Tasks complete | 17 |
| Tasks incomplete | 1 (6.3 Manual scenarios) |

## Spec Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Scenario | Runtime Evidence | Result |
|-------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| REQ-001 — Request from professional profile | Patient requests an appointment | Static inspection only; no automated test or manual runtime log | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-001 — Request from professional profile | Request date is in the past | Static inspection only; no automated test or manual runtime log | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-002 — Request form fields | Submitting a valid request | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-003 — Professional request list | Professional reviews requests | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-004 — Accept/reject | Professional confirms a request | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-004 — Accept/reject | Professional rejects an invalid state | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-005 — Upcoming appointments view | Viewing upcoming appointments | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-006 — Patient appointment list | Patient views appointments | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-007 — Appointment statuses | Lifecycle from request to completed | UI controls now present for all professional transitions; no manual runtime log | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| REQ-008 — Dashboard stat counts | Dashboard reflects real data | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |
| REQ-009 — i18n for new strings | Switching language | Static inspection only | ❌ UNTESTED |

**Compliance summary**: 0/11 scenarios have passing runtime evidence. All are untested except REQ-007, for which the professional UI controls are now present but still lack manual runtime verification.

## Correctness (Static Evidence)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Data model rename (`PENDING` → `REQUESTED`) | ✅ Implemented | `AppointmentStatus` enum has four values; default updated. |
| Prisma migration | ⚠️ Implemented with gap | Renames enum value and updates default; design also requested a separate backfill step, but `RENAME VALUE` effectively migrates existing rows. |
| Status transition guard | ✅ Implemented | `lib/appointments-status.ts` matches design: `REQUESTED → CONFIRMED/CANCELLED`, `CONFIRMED → CANCELLED/COMPLETED`. |
| Patient request action | ✅ Implemented | Validates role, validated professional, future date, notes length ≤ 500, and revalidates patient routes. |
| Professional response actions | ✅ Implemented | `acceptAppointment`, `rejectAppointment`, `cancelAppointment`, and `completeAppointment` are implemented and wired to the UI for their respective states. |
| Patient appointment list | ✅ Implemented | Real data, ordered ascending, includes counterparty name/notes. |
| Professional appointments page | ✅ Implemented | Request list + date-grouped upcoming list. |
| Dashboard counts | ✅ Implemented | Real counts for patient upcoming and professional upcoming + active patients; admin weekly count added. |
| i18n coverage | ✅ Implemented | `appointments` namespace complete in `es.ts`, `en.ts`, and `Dictionary`. |

## Coherence (Design)

| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Date-grouped list instead of full calendar | ✅ Yes | `DateGroupedAppointments` groups by ISO date. |
| Separate patient/professional action files | ✅ Yes | `app/paciente/dashboard/appointment-actions.ts` and `app/profesional/dashboard/appointment-actions.ts`. |
| Shared query helpers in `lib/appointments.ts` | ✅ Yes | Reused by both roles. |
| Authorization checks on every action | ✅ Yes | Role and ownership verified. |
| Chained PRs within 400-line budget | ✅ Yes | PR1 ~222, PR2 ~528, PR3 ~322, PR4 ~224 changed lines. |

## Issues Found

### CRITICAL

1. **Manual scenarios not executed (Task 6.3 unchecked)**  
   The task checklist explicitly leaves `6.3 Manual scenarios` unchecked. No automated tests exist, and no manual runtime evidence was produced for request, past-date validation, accept, reject, complete, language switch, or dashboard counts. Per the SDD verify contract, required scenarios without passing runtime evidence are `UNTESTED` and block archive readiness.

2. ~~**Professional cannot cancel or complete appointments from the UI**~~  
   **Resolved by PR4a remediation.** `DateGroupedAppointments` now renders **Cancel** and **Complete** buttons for `CONFIRMED` appointments when `role="professional"`, invoking `cancelAppointment` and `completeAppointment` with `confirm()` dialogs and i18n confirmation messages.

### WARNING

3. **Migration lacks explicit backfill statement**  
   The design required the migration to "rename the PostgreSQL enum value, update the column default, and backfill existing `PENDING` rows to `REQUESTED`." The migration only contains `ALTER TYPE ... RENAME VALUE` and `ALTER TABLE ... SET DEFAULT`. Functionally, `RENAME VALUE` renames existing rows, but the backfill step is not explicit and may confuse future DBAs or reviewers.

4. **Patient dashboard count includes `REQUESTED` appointments**  
   Spec scenario REQ-008 says "two upcoming confirmed appointments" should show `2`. The implementation in `lib/appointments.ts` counts both `REQUESTED` and `CONFIRMED` for patients. This is a minor semantic deviation, though it matches the "Próximas citas" label.

5. **`lib/session.ts` tracked in current branch**  
   `lib/session.ts` is now tracked in `feature/appointments-calendar-pr4` (introduced by the same commit as the remediation). It is outside the intended scope of this slice and should be reviewed: remove it, add it to `.gitignore`, or commit it intentionally in its own change before merging. Do not commit it as part of this appointment slice.

### SUGGESTION

6. ~~**Add action buttons for cancel/complete to upcoming appointments**~~  
   **Implemented in PR4a remediation.** `DateGroupedAppointments` now renders **Cancel** and **Complete** buttons for `CONFIRMED` appointments when rendered for professionals.

7. **Add a minimal automated test framework or E2E suite**  
   The project has no unit, integration, or E2E tests. Adding even a small Playwright or Vitest setup for the appointment lifecycle would make future verification deterministic.

8. **Revalidate professional routes on patient request**  
   `requestAppointment` only revalidates `/paciente/dashboard/citas` and `/paciente/dashboard`. Revalidating `/profesional/dashboard/citas` and `/profesional/dashboard` would let professionals see new requests immediately.

## Remaining Work

Before this slice can be archived, the following must be completed:

1. Execute the manual scenario checklist from Task 6.3 and capture evidence:
   - Patient requests an appointment from a professional profile.
   - Submitting a past date returns a validation error.
   - Professional accepts a request → status becomes `CONFIRMED`.
   - Professional rejects a request → status becomes `CANCELLED`.
   - Professional cancels a confirmed appointment → status becomes `CANCELLED`.
   - Professional completes a confirmed appointment → status becomes `COMPLETED`.
   - Language switch to English updates appointment labels.
   - Dashboard stat cards reflect real counts.
2. Decide the fate of tracked `lib/session.ts` (remove, ignore, or commit intentionally).
3. (Optional) Add explicit backfill comment or statement to the migration for clarity.

| 2 | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr2` | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr1` | 508/20 | Patient request flow, modal, card, patient UI, i18n |
| 3 | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr3` | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr2` | 322/12 | Professional response actions, request list, professional citas page |
| 4 | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr4` | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr3` | 224/9 | Date-grouped calendar, dashboard counts, build verification |
| 4a | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr4` | `feature/appointments-calendar-pr3` | 90/7 | Remediation: professional Cancel/Complete UI controls with i18n |

All PRs remain within the 400-line review budget. The PR4a remediation keeps the slice within budget.
